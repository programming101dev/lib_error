# lib_error Repository Guide

Welcome to the `lib_error` repository — the error-handling foundation every other p101 library builds on, part of the Programming 101 C library collection. This guide will help you set up, build, and install the library.

## **Cloning the Repository**

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/programming101dev/lib_error.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd lib_error
```

Ensure the scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

## **Prerequisites**

To ensure you have all of the required tools installed, run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
```

If you are missing tools follow these [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPqlPD1mie5iwJ2XAcNGz7WeA86dTLerFXs9sAuwCco/edit?usp=drive_link). If something still looks wrong, `cmake -S . -B build` reports what actually works on this machine for this project.

## **Configuring the Build**

Tell CMake which compiler you want to use:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<compiler> -DP101_BUILD_LEVEL=1
```

To see the list of possible compilers:

```bash
cat supported_c_compilers.txt
```

Run it again any time to switch compilers; each compiler configures into its own build directory (e.g. `build-clang`, `build-gcc-15`).

## **Building**

To build the library run:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

This compiles through the strict analysis pipeline: the clang-format check, clang-tidy, cppcheck, the Clang static analyzer, and hundreds of warnings under `-Werror`. `cmake --build build --target format` applies the formatter and tidy fixes in place.

## **Testing**

`cmake -S . -B build -DP101_BUILD_LEVEL=3 && cmake --build build` is the one command to run before you submit: the format check, the strict build, the tests, and a short fuzz smoke run, with a single PASS/FAIL at the end.
The test tree covers error state, copy/move ownership, generic comparisons, and
strict C++ header use. The fuzz harness exercises arbitrary user messages,
copy/reset behavior, and comparison invariants.

## Example

[`lib_error_examples`](https://github.com/programming101dev/lib_error_examples)
contains the executable examples for this library, including the typed-error
lifecycle from creation through reset.

## **Installing**

To install the library run:

```bash
cmake --install build
```

You may need to run it via sudo, or give the user account access to the install directories. `cmake --build build --target uninstall` removes it again.

## **Adding or Removing Files**

The `CMakeLists.txt` is fixed and shared across every repository — do not edit it. When you add or remove a source or header, edit the lists in `config.cmake` (`p101_error_SOURCES`, `p101_error_HEADERS`, and `p101_error_LINK_LIBRARIES`), then re-configure and build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<compiler> -DP101_BUILD_LEVEL=1
cmake --build build
```
